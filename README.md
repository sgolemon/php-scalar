Scalar type hinting for PHP

```php
  function foo(int $bar) {
    echo "bar is $bar\n";
  }
  foo(123); // works
  foo(4.56); // throws an error
```

Types:
  * bool
  * int
  * float
  * num (either int of float)
  * string
  * scalar (any of the above types)
  * object (of any class)
  * resource

Note that you cannot specify default values for scalar types because the parser doesn't support it.
This extension was a quick and dirty proof-of-concept.  A prper implementation will require altering
the parser which can't be done from an extension (without stupid amounts of work).
